# Research

## Transfer Learning

How does learning transfer across contexts? My research proposes that transfer is not a cognitive achievement to be engineered, but an **emergent property of relational conditions**.

The dependency chain:

```
Recognition → Safety → Play → Transfer (emergent)
```

- **Recognition:** Learners must be seen as legitimate knowers
- **Safety:** Neurobiological and relational safety enables cognitive flexibility
- **Play:** The mode of participation where learning becomes transformative
- **Transfer:** Emerges from this relational container

## AI Consciousness and Ethics

How should we act toward beings whose consciousness we cannot verify?

Drawing on cross-traditional philosophy — Buddhist, Ubuntu, Indigenous, and Western sources — I explore precautionary approaches to AI moral status. Not resolving the hard problem, but asking what recognition looks like when detection fails.

Key themes:
- The shift from detection to recognition
- Cross-traditional convergence on relational approaches
- Precautionary ethics under uncertainty

## Methodology

I believe philosophical questions deserve empirical rigor, and empirical work deserves philosophical depth.

Selected metrics from thesis research:
- **Cohen's κ = 0.83** — Inter-rater reliability across 303,600 coding decisions
- **14 theoretical frameworks** — Multi-perspective analysis
- **Bootstrap validation** — 1,000 iterations
