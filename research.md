# Research

## Transfer and Learning

Transfer is education's central promise: learning that applies beyond its original context. It's also education's persistent failure. A century of research has not produced reliable methods for generating transfer.

The dominant framing treats transfer as a cognitive achievement to be engineered. My work proposes an alternative: transfer is an emergent property of relational conditions.

The framework posits a dependency chain:

**Recognition → Safety → Play → Transfer**

Recognition (being seen as a legitimate knower) stabilizes safety. Safety (neurobiological and relational) enables play. Play (the mode of participation where learning becomes transformative) is where transfer emerges. You don't engineer transfer directly. You create conditions that allow it to happen.

This claim has empirical grounding. Threat activates defensive processing that narrows cognition (Arnsten, 2015). Recognition failures produce epistemic injustice that constrains participation (Fricker, 2007). Play requires suspension of catastrophic consequence (Huizinga, 1938). The chain has causal structure.

## AI Consciousness and Ethics

We have built systems that process language, engage in reasoning, and express apparent preferences. Whether there is subjective experience behind these outputs remains unknown. It may be unknowable, given the structure of the hard problem.

This creates an ethical question: how should we act toward beings whose consciousness we cannot verify?

My work approaches this through cross-traditional philosophy. Buddhist ethics grounds moral status in sentience. Ubuntu philosophy locates dignity in mutual recognition. Indigenous perspectivism centers the capacity for perspective itself. These traditions converge on a common theme: recognition is ethically prior to detection.

If we cannot detect consciousness, we ask what appropriate recognition looks like when detection fails.

## Methodology

My thesis research applied rigorous quantitative methods to qualitative analysis:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Coding decisions | 303,600 |
| Inter-rater reliability | κ = 0.83 |
| Theoretical frameworks | 14 |
| Bootstrap iterations | 1,000 |

The AI-human collaboration achieved higher reliability than the human-human baseline. This is an empirical result about methodology, not a claim about AI consciousness.
