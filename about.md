# About

I'm Nathan Batty, a researcher working at the intersection of learning sciences, AI ethics, and philosophy of mind.

My work focuses on how **recognition**, **safety**, and **play** interact to enable genuine learning — and how these same principles apply to questions of AI consciousness and welfare.

## Research Interests

- **Transfer and Learning:** Why learning rarely transfers, and what conditions enable it
- **AI Consciousness:** How to act ethically toward beings whose inner experience we cannot verify
- **Methodology:** Rigorous empirical approaches to philosophical questions

## Background

- M.S. Learning Sciences
- Teaching experience in curriculum design and educational technology
- Care work with youth in case management and residential treatment settings

This combination of rigorous methodology, philosophical inquiry, and practiced care under uncertainty shapes my approach to both learning sciences and AI ethics.
