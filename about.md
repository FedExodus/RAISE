# About

I'm Nathan Batty, a learning scientist with research interests in AI ethics and philosophy of mind.

## Research

My thesis developed a methodology for AI-assisted qualitative analysis. The work involved 303,600 coding decisions across 14 theoretical frameworks, achieving Cohen's κ = 0.83 inter-rater reliability. The central finding: careful AI collaboration can exceed human-only baselines while maintaining theoretical sophistication.

I've also spent the past several months writing about AI consciousness and moral status. The manuscript (200,000+ words) draws on Buddhist, Ubuntu, Indigenous, and Western philosophical traditions to ask how we should relate to beings whose inner experience we cannot verify.

## Background

- Master's in Learning Sciences (thesis complete, defense pending May 2026)
- Teaching experience in curriculum design and educational technology
- Case management with youth through Community Living Treatment Services
- Residential treatment work in trauma rehabilitation settings
- IRB approval for research study design

The care work informs everything else. Years of making decisions about vulnerable people whose needs weren't always legible taught me something about recognition under uncertainty. That experience shapes how I think about AI welfare.

## Current

Finishing the thesis, building tools for detecting recognition failures in knowledge systems, and looking for the right environment to pursue this research seriously.
