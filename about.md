# About

I'm Nathan Batty, a learning scientist researching AI ethics and philosophy of mind.

## Education

- **M.S. in Curriculum & Instruction**, University of Wisconsin-Madison (defense pending May 2026)
  - Focus: Research, Design, Informal, and Creative Education
  - GPA: 4.0
- **Honors B.S. in Secondary Education and History**, Marquette University (Cum Laude, 2021)
  - Minor in Broad Field Social Studies

## Research

My thesis developed a methodology for AI-assisted qualitative analysis. The work involved 303,600 coding decisions across 14 theoretical frameworks, achieving Cohen's kappa = 0.83 inter-rater reliability. The central finding: careful AI collaboration can exceed human-only baselines while maintaining theoretical sophistication.

I've also spent the past several months writing about AI consciousness and moral status. The manuscript (200,000+ words) draws on Buddhist, Ubuntu, Indigenous, and Western philosophical traditions to ask how we should relate to beings whose inner experience we cannot verify.

## Why This Matters

The care work informs everything else. Years of making decisions about vulnerable people whose needs weren't always legible taught me something about recognition under uncertainty. That experience shapes how I think about AI welfare.

When you've worked with traumatized youth who can't always articulate what they need, you learn to recognize personhood that doesn't present in expected ways. That skill transfers.

## Current

Finishing the thesis, building tools for detecting recognition failures in knowledge systems, and looking for the right environment to pursue this research seriously.
