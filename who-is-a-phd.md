The PhD is in crisis. This much everyone agrees.

Graduate students abandon their programs at rates approaching fifty percent — a figure that has persisted for four decades. Those who remain report depression and anxiety at rates six times higher than the general population. The academic job market has contracted to what some scholars call "structural impossibility": of eight entering doctoral students, perhaps one will secure a tenure-track position. Recent graduates describe feeling overqualified for everything outside academia, qualified for nothing within it.

The responses follow predictable patterns. Career services offices retool workshops around "alternative careers" and "transferable skills." Academic associations publish white papers on "versatile PhDs." Graduate programs add professional development modules and entrepreneurship tracks. The underlying assumption remains constant: we know what a PhD is — the problem is finding something for them to do.

But what if the diagnosis is wrong?

What if the crisis isn't about what PhDs should *do*, but about who they have forgotten they *are*?

The degree itself offers a clue hiding in plain sight. *Philosophiae Doctor*: not "Philosopher" in the narrow disciplinary sense, but Teacher of the Love of Wisdom. The PhD was never supposed to be merely a research credential. It was designed as something more fundamental: a formation in connecting knowledge to teaching, scholarship to wisdom, specialized expertise to the broader questions that give such expertise meaning.

When we ask "What should PhDs do?" we accept the premise that they are products seeking markets, specialists seeking applications for their specialization. But when we ask "Who is a PhD?" we open a different kind of inquiry — one that might reveal the crisis as something other than overproduction or market misalignment.

I don't have clean answers yet. I'm not certain whether the PhD is broken beyond repair, whether it's exactly what our fragmented world needs, or whether the truth lies somewhere I haven't imagined. But I'm convinced the question "What should PhDs do?" cannot be answered until we've done archaeological work on a prior question: What did the PhD *become*, and what did it forget in the becoming?

This essay is that excavation.

## Why I Think I Can See This

Let me explain why I think I can see this.

I'm a graduate student who hasn't defended his master's thesis yet. This is not false modesty — it's methodologically significant. I haven't been fully formed by the doctoral process I'm examining. I'm early enough to still feel its contradictions as contradictions, before they become naturalized into "just how things are."

I also work with at-risk youth in trauma-informed settings. This teaches you the gap between institutional assumptions and lived reality. When systems claim to be universal, you learn to see who they actually exclude. This perspective reveals something about the PhD that's hard to see from the center: the crisis isn't a malfunction. It's the system working as designed, producing outcomes that serve some at the expense of many.

Finally, I was formed in Jesuit education — years of *cura personalis*, care for the whole person, and Ignatian discernment, learning to distinguish what leads toward life from what leads toward death. The Jesuits maintain a distinction largely lost in modern academia: the difference between training and formation. Training produces specialists who can perform functions. Formation develops persons who can exercise wisdom. The PhD was originally formation. What it has become is training. That's not a judgment — it's a diagnosis.

## The Original Vision: Guild and *Licentia*

The medieval doctorate emerged from the guild system, carrying all its assumptions about mastery, apprenticeship, and membership in a community of practice. The *licentia ubique docendi* — the license to teach anywhere — was granted not to specialists but to those who had demonstrated mastery of the *trivium* and *quadrivium*, the seven liberal arts that comprised all human knowledge. The word "doctor" meant teacher, not researcher. "Philosophy" meant the love of wisdom, not a narrow academic discipline.

This was formation, not credentialing. Like the master craftsman who spent seven years learning not just technique but the ethics and traditions of his guild, the medieval doctor underwent a transformation of character. He was being shaped to join a community of scholars whose primary purpose was the transmission and cultivation of wisdom.

## The German Revolution: Research as Purpose

Everything changed in 1810 when Wilhelm von Humboldt founded the University of Berlin on radically new principles. Drawing on idealist philosophy and Romantic notions of *Bildung* (cultivation), Humboldt reimagined the university as a site of *Wissenschaft* — systematic, methodical inquiry into the nature of reality itself.

Johann Gottlieb Fichte, the university's first rector, articulated the new requirement: doctoral candidates must make an "original contribution to knowledge." The phrase sounds familiar now, bureaucratic even. But in 1810, it was earth-shaking. For a millennium, scholars had been custodians and transmitters of received wisdom. Now, suddenly, they were expected to *create* new knowledge.

The German innovation introduced the seminar model, the laboratory as sacred space, the dissertation as proof of independent inquiry. And it worked brilliantly — for a time.

But something crucial happened: the PhD began to split from its teaching mission. Research became not just a method but the primary purpose. The love of wisdom began its slow metamorphosis into the production of specialized knowledge.

## The Great Fracture: The Birth of Disciplines

The real catastrophe — though it seemed like progress at the time — occurred between 1830 and 1910, when the unified field of human knowledge exploded into fragments. The word "scientist" was coined in 1833 because "natural philosopher" no longer captured what practitioners were actually doing. Natural philosophy splintered into physics, chemistry, biology, geology. Moral philosophy broke apart into economics, psychology, sociology, anthropology.

Between 1876 and 1905, the major American disciplinary associations were founded in rapid succession: the American Chemical Society (1876), the Modern Language Association (1883), the American Historical Association (1884), the American Economic Association (1885), the American Mathematical Society (1888), the Geological Society of America (1888), the American Psychological Association (1892), the American Physical Society (1899), the American Sociological Association (1905).

Each discipline developed its own journals, conferences, methodologies, and most importantly, its own definition of legitimate questions and valid approaches to answering them. The PhD became not a degree in *philosophy* — the love of wisdom — but a degree in a discipline, certifying expertise in an increasingly narrow domain.

By the time the word "interdisciplinary" was coined in the 1920s, it was already an acknowledgment of loss.

## When the Ampersand Left

There is another fracture that occurred simultaneously — one so mundane that no scholar seems to have connected it to the disciplinary transformation.

Until the 1830s, the English alphabet contained twenty-seven letters. The final letter was &.

For over eight hundred years, children learned their letters as: "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, &." The hornbooks at the Library of Congress preserve this. The Smithsonian. The New York Public Library.

Children recited it as "and per se and" — meaning "& by itself means 'and.'" This phrase, slurred by generations of young voices, eventually became "ampersand."

In 1835, Charles Bradlee copyrighted the Alphabet Song — "A, B, C, D, E, F, G..." — set to the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." The melody had a fatal constraint: it ended at Z.

The tune won. The letter lost.

Consider what the ampersand represents. It's not a phoneme like other letters. It doesn't map to a sound. It represents the function of *connection*. "A AND B." The ampersand is a relationship symbol — the sign of joining, of bringing together, of synthesis itself.

When we removed the ampersand from the alphabet, we erased the symbol for connection from the foundation of how we teach children to think.

Now look at the dates:

- Disciplinary fragmentation: 1830-1910
- Ampersand removal from the alphabet: 1835-1890s

The same historical moment.

I am not claiming causation. I am pointing to *convergence*. The same cultural forces that reorganized knowledge into separate disciplines simultaneously reorganized literacy to exclude the symbol for connection.

The degree forgot its own meaning just as the alphabet forgot its final letter.

## What Was Lost

In this historical excavation, we can see precisely what was lost:

*Teacher became Expert.* The medieval doctor was licensed to teach; the modern PhD is certified to research.

*Love of Wisdom became Narrow Specialization.* Philosophy once meant the integrated pursuit of truth across all domains of human inquiry. Now it means expert knowledge of an increasingly narrow subdomain.

*Formation became Credentialing.* The doctorate once represented a transformation of the whole person. Now it certifies technical competence.

*Guild membership became Career advancement.* The medieval doctor joined a community united by shared commitment to wisdom and teaching. The modern PhD enters a profession organized around individual achievement.

*Integrated knowledge became Fragmented expertise.* The seven liberal arts provided a unified framework. The disciplines provide ever-more-sophisticated tools for understanding ever-smaller pieces.

## Recovery

Recovery is not restoration. We cannot — and should not — return to a world where the boundaries between disciplines had not yet been drawn with precision. The gains of specialization are real. These we keep.

But we need not keep the fragmentation that came with them. The question is not whether to abandon specialization, but how to specialize while preserving the capacity for integration.

What might doctoral formation look like if it aimed not just to produce specialists, but to form connectors? Not just researchers who happen to teach, but teacher-scholars whose research and teaching exist in creative tension? Not just experts in narrow fields, but intellectuals capable of finding the threads that weave between disciplines?

Such formation would recognize that the work of the intellectual is not just methodological but moral, not just analytical but relational. It would form whole persons, not just cognitive specialists.

This vision requires recovering the ampersand. Not research or teaching, but research & teaching in creative dialogue. Not my discipline or yours, but the patient work of finding how insights connect.

## Who is a PhD?

So I return to the question that began this inquiry: Who is a PhD?

The question cannot be answered in the abstract. It can only be lived into, embodied, discovered in the particular texture of each scholar's calling. The ampersand — that connector between worlds — will manifest differently in each life, each discipline, each moment of encounter with students and ideas.

What I can say is this: the question itself opens something. To ask "Who is a PhD?" instead of "What is a PhD?" is to remember that behind every dissertation, every conference paper, every lecture, there is a person. A person formed by questions, called to serve something larger than themselves, entrusted with the ancient work of teaching others to love wisdom.

The doctoral programs that will thrive will be the ones that remember this: formation is not just about producing experts, but about forming teachers. Teachers who can hold both depth and breadth, both rigor and wonder, both their discipline and the world beyond it.

Teachers of the love of wisdom.

Who is a PhD?

The question is yours to answer. The question is yours to become.
